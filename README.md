ABC - Automatic Burndown Chart

### What is this Code about?
The main purpose of this program is to be used as a project planner. 
The program pulls a list of ordered actions, as well as their ETA. Then depending on whether priority of tasks matters, it uses a greedy algorithm to optimize for a 8 hour workday (or however long you work for). Then a scrum-style burndown chart is created and an expected date of termination will be provided.
This program can also track progress of those tasks by reading a column of "Completed" tasks and superimposing a line graph of current progress.

This program also has an burndown velocity line that takes the slope of the volume of previous completed tasks, and gives the 'estimated real time of completion'. This can extend past the due date, or before. It is meant to visually show one's progress. 

This tool personally helped me achieve deadlines faster because I had it live on a monitor and it would give me continuous feedback.
